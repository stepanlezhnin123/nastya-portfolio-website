My dream came true when I got accepted to <a href="https://www.vives.be/en/commercial-sciences-business-management-and-informatics/bachelor-hotel-management-hospitality">VIVES University</a>. During my studies, I have found a great workplace at a 5-star hotel, <a href="https://thenotary.be/">The Notary</a>. Also, the university has provided me with two internship places already, where I had an amazing experience.</p>

                            <p>Right now, I am working at a five star boutique hotel, The Notary. I work as a student, which means I don‚Äôt have a fixed position at a hotel. I work as a housekeeper, receptionist and sometimes I help with breakfast. Sometimes I have night shifts, which includes also working at the bar. I really enjoy working, because people that I work with are respectful, caring, and professional.‚Äã</p>
                            <p>One of the biggest roles that was given to me through out my work period so far, was to manage housekeeping staff on the owners wedding, which happened in summer. I had to control how clean public areas are and if everything was on its right place.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Ibis Budget Blankenberge ‚≠ê ‚≠ê</div>
                            <p>During my six-week internship at ibis budget Blankenberge, I primarily handled reception duties, assisting with breakfast, laundry, and cleaning during quieter periods. The initial week brought a mix of excitement and stress as I navigated being new and alone, accelerating my learning curve and fostering adaptability. My commitment to the internship was unwavering, solidifying my passion for the hotel industry. Exploring various hotel departments was a goal before the internship, providing insights into front office, management, revenue, sales, and more. Coming from a boutique hotel background, the structured approach at ibis budget stood out.‚Äã</p>
                            <p>Effective communication emerged as a key lesson during the internship. Seeking assistance from the neighboring Mercure hotel and addressing issues with guests showcased the importance of this skill in the hospitality sector. A notable incident involved an oversight in city tax collection from a guest extending her stay due to financial constraints. Promptly rectifying the error highlighted the significance of attention to detail and proactive problem-solving.‚Äã</p>
                            <p>Post-internship, I am confident in my career path, with the hotel industry being my passion. Positive interactions with colleagues and guests contribute to job satisfaction, and I envision a future role beyond a receptionist. In conclusion, my time at ibis budget was memorable, creating lasting friendships and professional relationships. I am content with the results, affirming that the hotel industry is where I belong.‚Äã</p>

                            <p>My first internship happened at the Hotel Jan Brito. My main task through the week was to try and see how every department works. Hotel Jan Brito is a small boutique hotel with 37 rooms. I started my internship from the front office (reception). The hotel had keys for each room instead of cards. It was old fashion way.</p>
                            <p>My first day was an observative day. Later that week, I have continued exploring the hotel. My next job was helping with breakfast. Mostly cleaning up, because my day started at 9. Since then, my first task of the day was Breakfast Buffet. After breakfast, I would go and see how Housekeeping Department worked. I was shocked that only males were in Housekeeping. Also I tried helping at the bar by serving people. I got to know a lot of people in this hotel, which was great! ‚Äã
                                During the week I really felt what it is like working at the hotel.</p>
                            <p>I saw the difference between western European people and myself. I am from Eastern European. Our mindsets and behaviors are different. The most important thing to have is patience and calmness. I am very energetic and driven person. Whereas, at the hotel I had to slow down my energy and focus on details and guests. ‚Äã
                                My favorite thing during the internship was working at the reception. Greeting people and listening to their needs was a very pleasant thing to do. I cannot say anything that I didn‚Äôt like. Everything was so interesting! ‚Äã
                                At the end I was happy with my internship, I understood that it is a industry that I would like to pursue in the future.</p>
